# Requirements

## Introduction (with ofcourse the Research)
Heylo World!

This project is all about data, interface & representation in general. I would like to contribute to the training programs & even sports analytics to give them a 'common platform' where they can:
- View
- Evaluate
- Segregate

Given Data

## Objective (The Motivation & The Inspiration)
For example: A table where a list of football players in a team is present (Taking inspiration from FIFA, my favourite game and I would like to propose this project as a feature as well to them). It will contain Name, Age, Position, Number of Games Played, Goals, Assists, Goal Contributions (Goals + Assists), Clean Sheets, International Performance, Recommended Style of Play/Area in XI (Based on Statistics & Inputs via Interactions) etc. to name a few. This will not only make a unified structure of information but also suggest/recommend the future of an individual to the admin/manager.

## Salient Features of this Project
1) Adapatable: You can use this application for any people/participant list, literally.
2) Ranking & Grading: To utilize the processed numbers as a tool for it.
3) Organizing: To plan the potential ahead.
